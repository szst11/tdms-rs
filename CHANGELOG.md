# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Companion index files (`.tdms_index`)**: reading now uses a sibling
  `<file>.tdms_index` to build the group/channel/property index (`TDSh` tag),
  per the `nptdms` layout; the `.tdms` file is opened lazily only for channel
  data.
  - `OpenOptions` for reader customization: `use_index_file`,
    `create_index_if_missing`, and `verify_index`.
  - `TdmsWriterOptions` (with `write_index_file`) to emit a `.tdms_index`
    companion file when writing.
  - `TdmsError::IndexMismatch` for failing verification.
  - A stale, empty, or corrupt index is skipped in favor of the data file;
    regeneration on open is best-effort, so read-only directories keep working.
- **Fixtures**: the golden corpus now ships `.tdms_index` companions for every
  `.tdms` file, and the golden test runs each fixture through both the index and
  data-file parsing paths.

### Changed
- Python tooling now uses `uv` instead of `pip`/`requirements.txt` alone;
  corpus generation writes index files (see `tools/README.md` and `AGENTS.md`).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-16

### Changed
- **API Consolidation**: Finalized the v2.0.0 API surface for production use.
- **Improved Examples**: All examples are now self-contained and generate their own test data.
- **Renamed Examples**: `read_zero_copy.rs` renamed to `read_chunks.rs` to better reflect its behavior.
- **CI/CD Hygiene**: Enabled strict Clippy warnings and fixed all linting issues.
- **Formatting**: Applied project-wide formatting using `cargo fmt`.

### Fixed
- Fixed Clippy warning regarding `get(0)` vs `first()`.
- Fixed examples that were failing due to missing data files.

  - Support for all basic types: `&str`, `String`, `i8`-`i64`, `u8`-`u64`, `f32`, `f64`, `bool`, `(i64, u64)`
- **Complete Helper Method Family**: Type-safe data access for all TDMS types
  - `as_i8()`, `as_i16()`, `as_i64()`, `as_u8()`, `as_u16()`, `as_u32()`, `as_u64()` 
  - `as_bool()` in addition to existing `as_f64()`, `as_f32()`, `as_i32()`, `as_string()`
- **Ergonomic Channel Lookup**: Convenient methods for accessing channels
  - `file.get_channel("group", "channel")` for direct access
  - `file.try_get_channel("group", "channel")` with descriptive error messages
  - `group.channel("name")` for group-level access
- **Property Constants**: Well-known TDMS property names to avoid magic strings
  - `properties::UNIT_STRING`, `properties::INCREMENT`, `properties::START_TIME`, etc.
- **Enhanced Property Helpers**: Additional convenience methods for common properties
  - `channel.description()`, `channel.sensor_type()`, `channel.sample_count()`

### Features
